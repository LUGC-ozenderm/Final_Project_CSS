                <p>Spring rolls, a beloved appetizer in Asian cuisine, offer a tantalizing blend of flavors and

                    herbs like cilantro and mint, adding layers of freshness and complexity to the taste. Once filled,
                    the wrapper is carefully rolled into a neat cylinder and either fried until crispy or served fresh,
                    offering contrasting textures of crunchy exterior and tender interior. The taste of spring rolls is
